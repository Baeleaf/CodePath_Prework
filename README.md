Submitted by: Kwame Robertson

Time spent: 25 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [ ] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Added an app icon image for the app
- [ ] Added a Launch Screen to the app
- [ ] Added color for pleasant use

## Notes

I had trouble implementing a lot of the required and optional features. I was unable to get the SettingsViewController and the Loading and Saving features enabled. I had trouble understanding the code past what was done in the video walkthrough. I looked up other walkthrough to try and implement some of their features however I ran into problems trying to implement the settings navigation bar. There are several challenges that I have encountered that I am still working on implementing.
